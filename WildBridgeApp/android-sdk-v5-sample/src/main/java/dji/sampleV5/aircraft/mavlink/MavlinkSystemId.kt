/**
 * A stable, unique MAVLink system id per aircraft.
 *
 * QGroundControl treats two vehicles with the same system id as the same vehicle (its
 * "Multi-Vehicle Gotchas" note — the symptom is the Plan view jerking between positions), so every
 * WildBridge device must advertise a distinct id. The id is derived from a stable per-aircraft key
 * and can be overridden explicitly by the `wb_mav_0_sysid` preference.
 *
 * The valid unique range is 1..254; 0 and 255 are reserved in MAVLink (broadcast/all), so this
 * helper never produces them.
